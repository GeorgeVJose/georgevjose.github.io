## Research Projects

### Medical AI Safety: Demography Bias and Fairness of Medical Imaging in Vision-Language models
*Ongoing Research as part of Masters program*

> Auditing [CheXagent’s](https://stanford-aimi.github.io/chexagent.html) chest X-ray predictions for demographic bias by linking performance disparities across gender, race, and age to internal model confidence signals

**Methodology & Findings:**
- Probed CheXagent using forward hooks to capture internal signals from vision and decoder modules
- Compared subgroup performance disparities with patterns in these internal confidence measures.
- Clear subgroup disparities in TPR and FPR for certain pathologies, with both under and over-detection patterns.
- Ethical Implications in Medical Imaging

**Technologies:** PyTorch, Medical Imaging, Demography Bias, Fairness, Vision-Language Models
