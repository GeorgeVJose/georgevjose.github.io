# Minimal Portfolio

This is a minimal portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main entry point.
- `css/style.css`: Styles for the site.
- `js/app.js`: Logic to render content and handle interactions.
- `js/data.js`: Contains all the portfolio data (Profile, Experience, Projects, etc.). **Edit this file to update your content.**

## Updating Content

To update your portfolio, open `js/data.js` and modify the JSON objects. The site will automatically reflect changes.

## Deployment

This site is ready for GitHub Pages. The `.nojekyll` file ensures that GitHub processes it as a static site without Jekyll.
