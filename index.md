## Experience
<a id="experience"></a>

### Project Research Assistant — Indian Institute of Technology Bombay

- Designed and engineered **DRISHT-E**, a video-based traffic-analytics platform that detects vehicles, forms trajectories, and exports statistical insights.
- Curated a drone-based dataset of ~186 k frames with 4 M bounding-box annotations.
- Trained and benchmarked multiple object-detection networks, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy on test videos.

### Research Intern — Australian Institute for Machine Learning

- Developed a **PointNet++** pipeline to localise dental landmarks on 3-D dentition point clouds.
- Achieved sub-millimetre (< 1 mm) localisation accuracy on 91 % of test landmarks.

## Research &amp; Projects
<a id="research-projects"></a>

### Medical AI Safety

- Investigating demographic bias in pathology prediction with the **LLaVa-Med** vision–language model.
- Probing models for latent patient-demography signals.

### Dental Landmark Identification

- Delivered high-precision (< 1 mm) palatal-landmark detection on 3-D scans.

### DRISHT-E

- Fully-automated traffic-data extractor for unstructured, non-lane-based road scenarios.

### Hygroscopic Properties of Atmospheric Aerosols

- Analysed high-altitude aerosol hygroscopicity data to study monsoon-modulating pollution.
- Simulated thermodynamic models and visualised results to compare aerosol characteristics.
